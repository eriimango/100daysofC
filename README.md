# 100daysofC
I've decided to upload my learning codes for C for engineering course in taking this summer.

Hi! Summer 2021 I enrolled into a mechatronics program 
 and was required to take C for engineering. Since I've been writing 
 hella codes. I am going to upload about 100 of them throughout this summer.
 At the end I will upload at least 2 big projects, and I will update this readme
 to include my take on C and how learning it can benefit my future endeavors.
 until them chao!

My take on C: pending......
